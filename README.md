##BirdFeeder auto-populates feeds based on a hashtag inputed by a user.

Birdfeeder acts as a Feed Reader that parses RSS and XML feeds and renders them as HTML for user consumption. A default list of hashtags will be presented to a user which they can then customise to their own liking. The hashtag urls will be sourced from Twitter using their search API.
